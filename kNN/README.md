# K Nearest Neighbors

### Approach
- Placing all data in a structure: 'datapoint'
- The structure contains both independent variable and the dependent variables
- 'Datapoint' Structure:
  - float array for features
  - strings for classes (so you can input numbers or strings directly as class names)
